Stages are divided into the following groups.
- **Source**
- **Build**
- **Deployment**
- **Feature**

### Source
This is a stage that gets the source code to build.

#### Source - GitHub
You can select the [source repository](/Dev%20Tools/Pipeline/zh/environment-config/#source-repository) that you added in **Source Repository Settings** of **Environment Settings**.

#### Source - GitLab
You can select the [source repository](/Dev%20Tools/Pipeline/zh/environment-config/#source-repository) that you added in **Source Repository Settings** of **Environment Settings**.

### Build
This is a stage to build

#### Build - Jenkins
You can build using Jenkins that you configured yourself. You can select the [build tool](/Dev%20Tools/Pipeline/zh/environment-config/#build-tool) you added in **Build Tool Settings** of **Environment Settings**. You can select **Build Job** and enter **Build Job Parameters**.
You can set **Start Condition** and **End Condition** of the **artifact**. You can decide whether or not to start a stage by setting the **Start Condition**. You can set an **End Condition** to set stage output as an artifact.

#### Build - NHN Cloud Build Tool
You can use the build tools provided by NHN Cloud.
- Build Environment Settings
  - You can select the [image registry](/Dev%20Tools/Pipeline/zh/environment-config/#image-registry) you added in the **Image Registry Settings** in **Environment Settings**.
  - Select the **Image Name** of the environment to build, set the **Build Tool Performance**, **Build Time Limit (minutes),** and **Build Command**.
  
- Build Result Settings
  - Set the **Dockerfile Path** of the build result, and the **Dockerfile Execution Path**.
  - Select a **Image Registry** and decide on **Image Name**, and the build result is pushed to the selected repository.
  - If **Use Tag Format** is selected, the tag format is fixed, and the image is created with dynamically generated tags in the form of `_{BUILD_NUMBER}`.

- Artifact Settings
  - You can decide whether to start stages by setting **Start Condtion**.
  - You can set stage output as an artifact by setting **End Condition**.

#### Build - Bake (Manifest)
You can build using a Helm package file or [Chart Repository](/Dev%20Tools/Pipeline/zh/environment-config/#chart-repository)that users configured themselves. 
- Set the chart name as the name of the output configured with the Helm engine.
- Set the namespace as the namespace of the output configured with the Helm engine.
- Template
  - For repository type, select a repository that is added in [Source Repository Settings](/Dev%20Tools/Pipeline/zh/environment-config/#source-repository) or [Chart Repository Settings](/Dev%20Tools/Pipeline/zh/environment-config/#chart-repository) of **Environment Settings**.
  - When you set a repository type as **GitHub file** or **GitLab file**.
    - Enter the Helm package file path for the path.
    - Enter the branch of GitHub or GitLab for the branch name.
  - When you specify **Helm Chart** for the repository type
    - For the chart repository name, you can select one of repositories set in[Chart Repository Settings](/Dev%20Tools/Pipeline/zh/environment-config/#chart-repository).
    - For the chart name, you can choose any chart name available in the chart repository's configuration.
    - For the chart version, you to select a chart version available in the chart repository's configuration.
- Override
  - Repository Information
    - You can select in the same way as for templates.
    - Create a build output using the template as default and replacing it with what you specify in the override.
  - Key / Value
    - Enter a value consisting of key and value, create a build result by replacing a specific value.
  - Replace Basic Type
    - If the option is checked, when adding the override value, --set is used instead of --set--string. 
- Artifact
  - You can set the **Start Condition** and **End Condition** of ** Artifact**. You can set a start condition to determine whether to start stages. You can set **End Condition** to set stage products as artifacts.

### Deployment
This is a stage to deploy to the Kubernetes environment.

#### Deployment - Deploy
- You can select the [deployment target](/Dev%20Tools/Pipeline/zh/environment-config/#deployment-target) you added in **Deployment Target Settings** in **Environment Settings**. 
Enter **Stage Name**, **Deployment Target**, and **Manifest** to use for deployment. 
If the tag format is used in the build stage, when the docker image tag of **Manifest** is entered as `_{BUILD_NUMBER}`, you can deploy as the image with the most recent number among the images built in the tag format.
See the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment ) for how to write **Manifest**.
- You can select **Manifest Source** as artifacts. The selected artifact must be created in Manifest format.
  - You can select an artifact created in the pipeline.
  - You can select a specific file from the repository as an artifact. 
- You can set the **Start Condition** and **End Condition** of ** Artifact**. You can set a start condition to determine whether to start stages. You can set **End Condition** to set stage products as artifacts.

If you uncheck **Run Condition**, the next stage runs without waiting for the execution status of the selected pipeline.

![stage-guide-16](https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_pipeline/2023-08-29/stage-guide-16.png)
