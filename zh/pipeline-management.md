### Create a Pipeline

Pipeline stores the application deployment flow as a pipeline consisting of one or more stages. In Create Pipeline, you can create a basic pipeline that works in the following order: **Build Source Code** > **Create Container Image** > **Upload Container Image** > **Deploy Container Image** and create a pipeline by uploading pipeline template files.

![pipeline-guide-01](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_pipeline/2023-03-28/pipeline-guide-01.png)

Click **Create Pipeline** in **Pipeline Management**. Pipeline creation is performed in the following steps.
- Entering pipeline information
- Source settings
- Build Settings
- Deployment settings
- Final review and pipeline creation

#### Entering Pipeline Information

Enter basic information of the pipeline.

![pipeline-guide-33](https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_pipeline/2023-09-26/pipeline-guide-33.png)

Enter the pipeline name and pipeline description, and click **Next**.

Additionally, you can create a pipeline with pipeline template files (JSON is used for pipeline template files).

![pipeline-guide-34](https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_pipeline/2023-09-26/pipeline-guide-34.png)

Enter a pipeline name and description and upload a pipeline template file to click **Next**.

#### Source Settings

Set the source repository used when building the source code in the NHN Cloud build tool. If you do not use the NHN Cloud build tool or do not build the source code in the NHN Cloud build tool, you can skip this step.

![pipeline-guide-03](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_pipeline/2023-03-28/pipeline-guide-03.png)

Enter the stage name, the source repository registered in the environment settings, and the branch to build the source code from, and click **Next**.

#### Build Settings

In the build settings, you can use the NHN Cloud build tool or the build tool registered in the environment settings. Enter a stage name and select the build tool to use under **Build Tool**.

![pipeline-guide-04](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_pipeline/2023-03-28/pipeline-guide-04.png)

The NHN Cloud build tool allows you to build the application source code stored in the source repository without installing additional software, create a container image with the built application, and upload the created container image to the image registry.
In **Build Environment Settings**, enter the method of building the application using the source code set in **Source Settings**. You can enter the container image to use for building the source code, the performance of the build machine, and the command to use for the build.
In **Build Result Settings**, enter how to create a container image with the built application. You can enter the Dockerfile to use when creating the container image, the image registry to upload the created container image to, and the name and tag of the container image to upload.
When you click the **Use Tag Format** box, you can use the image tag format. If you use the image tag format, the tag of the created image is used as the build number given by the NHN Cloud build tools. The generated tags are of the form `_{BUILD_NUMBER}` and BUILD_NUMBER indicates the build number.
The build number is numeric data that increments with each build. When using the image tag format, the tag is fixed in the form of `_{BUILD_NUMBER}`.

![pipeline-guide-05](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_pipeline/2023-03-28/pipeline-guide-05.png)
You can set **Start Condition** and **End Condition** by using the **Artifact** settings from NHN Cloud Build Tool.
An **artifact** set as a starting condition is checked for existence at the start of the stage to determine whether or not to proceed with the stage.
An **artifact** configured as an end condition sets the production of the stage as an **artifact**.

#### Artifacts that can be set in NHN Cloud Build Tools

For GitHub and GitLab, if a branch is not entered, the master branch is used as default.

| Artifact Type    | Use Condition  | Path or Reference Setting Examples                                                                                                                                                                                       |

![pipeline-guide-06](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_pipeline/2023-03-28/pipeline-guide-06.png)

The build tool added in the environment settings allows you to run the build tool's build job. If you select a build job to run, you can enter additional parameters for the build job.

![pipeline-guide-07](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_pipeline/2023-03-28/pipeline-guide-07.png)
You can set **Start Condition** and **End Condition** by using the **Artifact** settings.
An **artifact** set as a starting condition is checked for existence at the start of the stage to determine whether or not to proceed with the stage.
An **artifact** configured as an end condition sets the production of the stage as an **artifact**.

#### **Artifacts** that can be set in Build Tool

For GitHub and GitLab, if a branch is not entered, the master branch is used as default.

| Artifact Type    | Use Condition  | Path or Reference Setting Examples                                                                                                                                                                                        |

After completing the build settings, click **Next**.

#### Deployment Settings

In deployment settings, you can set how the container image is deployed to the deployment target added in the environment settings.

![pipeline-guide-08](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_pipeline/2023-03-28/pipeline-guide-08.png)

Enter the stage name, deployment target, and Kubernetes Manifest to use for deployment, and click **Next**. See the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment) for how to write a Manifest.

![pipeline-guide-09](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_pipeline/2023-03-28/pipeline-guide-09.png)

If you used the tag format in the build settings, enter `_{BUILD_NUMBER}` for the tag in the Docker image input area as shown above. When `_{BUILD_NUMBER}` is entered in the image tag, it is deployed with the most recent number.
To use the tag format, you must set build stage and NHN Cloud build tool.

![pipeline-guide-10](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_pipeline/2023-03-28/pipeline-guide-10.png)
You can set **Start Condition** and **End Condition** by using the **Artifact** settings.
An **artifact** set as a starting condition is checked for existence at the start of the stage to determine whether or not to proceed with the stage.
An **artifact** configured as an end condition sets the production of the stage as an **artifact**.
Even if the stage fails because there are no Kubernetes objects in the entered manifest that match the **End Condition**, the manifest can be applied to the Kubernetes cluster.

#### **Artifacts** that can be set in the deployment settings.

For GitHub and GitLab, if a branch is not entered, the master branch is used as default.

| Artifact Type    | Use Condition  | Path or Reference Setting Examples                                                                                                                                                                                        |

### Run a Pipeline

There are two ways to run a pipeline: manual run and automatic run.

#### Manual Run

Manual run allows you to run your pipeline when you want.

![pipeline-guide-13](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_pipeline/2023-03-28/pipeline-guide-13.png)

In **Pipeline Management**, click ▶︎ (Manual Run). when the dialog box appears, click **OK**.

#### Autorun

Autorun lets you configure your pipeline to run automatically when an event occurs in your GitHub  or GitLab repository or when a container image in your image registry is updated.

![pipeline-guide-14](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_pipeline/2023-03-28/pipeline-guide-14.png)

Click **Autorun Settings** and click **Add** in the **Autorun Settings** dialog box.

![pipeline-guide-15](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_pipeline/2023-09-26/pipeline-guide-15.png)

### GitHub Autorun Settings

Using a GitHub webhook, you can configure your pipeline to run automatically when an event occurs in a repository on GitHub or GitHub Enterprise. Set the autorun type to GitHub, enter the repository's organization or user name, project name, branch, and secret, and click **OK**.
To set autorun by tag, enter the tag name in the **Branch or Tag** item, such as 'refs/tags/tagname'. You can use a JAVA regular expression for the 'tagname' part.
After setting up autorun with tags, run the build with the tags set when using NHN Cloud build tool. If you want to run a build with tags in the Build - Jenkins stage, you need to configure the following settings.

Set parameters as follows in Jenkins.
![pipeline-guide-39.png](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_pipeline/2023-09-26/pipeline-guide-39.png)
![pipeline-guide-40.png](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_pipeline/2023-09-26/pipeline-guide-40.png)
Enter as follows in **Build Job Parameter** from Set Build Tool.

|---|---|
| URL | https://kr1-pipeline.api.nhncloudservice.com/webhooks/git/gitlab |
| Trigger | Select Push events |
| Secret | Do not set |
| SSL verification | Select Enable SSL verification |

#### Precautions for GitLab Webhook settings

When setting autorun with GitLab's user name, make sure to set the user name to be the same as GitLab's user name. If the user name is set differently, autorun may not work.

![pipeline-guide-19](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_pipeline/2023-03-28/pipeline-guide-19.png)

#### Image Repository Autorun Setting

![pipeline-guide-20](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_pipeline/2023-03-28/pipeline-guide-20.png)

If you want the pipeline to run automatically when the container image is updated, set **Image Registry** for **Autorun Type**.
After selecting **the image registry** registered in **the environment settings**, enter **Image Name**. Enter the image name in the form of `registry name/image name` for NHN Cloud container registry.
For Docker Hub, enter in the form of `docker hub account/image name`. **Tag** can use JAVA regular expression and is automatically executed when a tag matching the entered tag is pushed.
If you do not enter a tag, it will be automatically executed when a new tag except latest is pushed.
When finished, click **Confirm**.

![pipeline-guide-21](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_pipeline/2023-03-28/pipeline-guide-21.png)

When a new pipeline is created, **Prevent Autorun** is set as default. If you want the pipeline to run automatically, you must change **Prevent Autorun** to **Disable**. After selecting the pipeline, click **Change** under Prevent Autorun at the bottom of Basic Information. In the Set Autorun Prevention dialog box, select **Disable** and click **OK**.

![pipeline-guide-22](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_pipeline/2023-03-28/pipeline-guide-22.png)

To check the detailed information about the running pipeline, select a running pipeline and click **Details** under Recent Run Status in Basic Information at the bottom.

#### Run History

If you run your pipeline manually or automatically, you can view the run history on the Run History tab.

![pipeline-guide-26](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_pipeline/2023-06-20/pipeline-guide-26.png)

### Manage a Pipeline

You can add, change, or delete stages that make up the pipeline.

![pipeline-guide-23](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_pipeline/2023-03-28/pipeline-guide-23.png)

After selecting a pipeline, click **Stage** at the bottom to display the screen to manage stages. Click **Add Stage**, and the **Add Stage** dialog box appears.
